# emergency-vehicle-classification
 emergency vehicle classifier which takes an image as the input and output's the classification that whether the image is an emergency vehicle or not.

used pre-trained VGG-19 as the base model and then added my own ANN futher to get the results.

I have trained this model on closed source dataset of images which I have removed (sorry) and replaced with some dummy helpful data.
